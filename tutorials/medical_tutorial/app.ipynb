High blood\\npressure is estimated to account for approximately 13% of CVD deaths, while tobacco\\naccounts for 9%, diabetes 6%, lack of exercise 6%, and obesity 5%.[3] Rheumatic heart\\ndisease may follow untreated strep throat.[3]\\nIt is estimated that up to 90% of CVD may be preventable.[9][10] Prevention of CVD\\ninvolves improving risk factors through : healthy eating, exercise, avoidance of tobacco\\nsmoke and limiting alcohol intake.[3] Treating risk factors, such as high blood pressure,\\nblood lipids and diabetes is also beneficial.[3] Treating people who have strep throat with\\nantibiotics can decrease the risk of rheumatic heart disease.[11] The use of aspirin in people\\nwho are otherwise healthy is of unclear benefit.[12][13]\\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide except Africa.[3] Together\\nCVD resulted in 17.9 million deaths (32.1% ) in 2015, up from 12.3 million (25.8% ) in\\n1990.[5][4] Deaths, at a given age, from CVD are more common and have been increasing in\\nmuch of the developing world, while rates have declined in most of the developed world\\nsince the 1970s .[14][15] Coronary artery disease and stroke account for 80% of CVD deaths\\nin males and 75% of CVD deaths in females.[3] Most cardiovascular disease affects older\\nadults.

Genetic cardiovascular disease can occur either as a consequence of single variant (Mendelian) or polygenic\\ninfluences.[26] There are more than 40 inherited cardiovascular disease that can be traced to a single disease-causing DNA variant,\\nalthough t hese conditions are rare.[26] Most common cardiovascular diseases are non- Mendelian and are thought  to be due to hundr eds\\nor thousands of genetic variants (know n as single nucleotide polymorphisms), each associated with a small effect.[27][28]\\nAge is the most important risk factor in developing cardiovascular or heart diseases, with\\napproximately a tripling of risk with each decade of life.[29] Coronary fatty streaks can begin\\nto form in adolescence.[30] It is estimated that 82 percent of people who die of coronary heart\\ndisease are 65 and older.[31] Simultaneously, the risk of stroke doubl es every decade after age\\n55.[32]\\nMultiple explanations are proposed to explain why age increases the risk of\\ncardiovascular/heart diseases. One of them relates to serum cholesterol level.[33] In most\\npopul ations, the serum total cholesterol level increases as age increases. In men, this increase\\nlevels off around age 45 to 50 years.

However, delays in recognition and diagnosis of celiac disease can cause irreversible heart\\ndamage.[20]\\nA lack of good s leep, in amount or quality, is documented as increasing cardiovascular risk in bot h adults and teens. Recommendations\\nsugge st that Infants typically need 12 or more hours of sleep per day, adolescent at least eight or nine hours, and adults seven or eight.\\nAbout one-third of adult Americans get less than the recommended seven hours of sleep per night, and in a study of teenagers, just 2.2\\npercent of those studied got enough sleep, many of whom did not get good quality sleep. Studies have shown that short sleepers\\ngetting less than seven hour s sleep per night have a 10 pe rcent to 30 pe rcent higher risk of cardiovascular disease.[7][52]\\nSleep disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing and insomnia, are also associated with a higher cardiometabolic risk.[53] An\\nestimated 50 t o 70 m illion Americans have insomnia, sleep apnea or other chronic sleep disorders.\\nIn addition, sleep research displays differences in race and class. Short sleep and poor sleep tend to be more frequently reported in\\nethnic minorities than in whites.

Psychosocial factors, environmental exposures, health behaviours,\\nand health-care access and quality contribute to socio-econom ic differentials in cardiovascular disease.[56] The Commission on Social\\nDeterminants of Health recommended that more equal distributions of power, wealth, education, housing, environmental factors,\\nnutrition, a nd he alth care were needed to address inequalities in cardiovascular disease and non- communicable diseases.[57]\\nParticulate matter has been studied for its short- and long-term exposure effects on cardiovascular disease. Currently, airborne particles\\nunde r 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) are the major focus, in which gradients are used to determine CVD risk. Overall, long-term\\nPM exposure increased rate of atherosclerosis and inflammation. In regards to short-term exposure (2 hours), every 25 μg/m3 of PM2.5\\nresulted in a 48% increase of CVD mortality risk.[58] In addition, after only 5 days of exposure, a rise in systolic (2.8 mmHg) and\\ndiastolic (2.7 mmHg) blood pressure occurred for every 10.5 μg/m3 of PM2.5.[58] Other research has implicated PM2.5 in irregular\\nheart rhythm, reduced heart rate variability (decreased vagal tone), and most notably heart failure.[58][59] PM2.5 is also linked to\\ncarotid artery thickening and increased risk of acute myocardial infarction.[58][59]\\nExisting cardiovascular disease or a previous cardiovascular event, such as a heart attack or stroke, is the stronge st predictor of a future', metadata={'page': 3, 'source': 'data\\\\Cardiovascular_disease.pdf'})]"
