       "\"You: Thank you for coming in today, Nikki. I'd like to start by asking you some questions about what you have witnessed at the crime scene. Could you please describe, in detail, what you saw when you first arrived?\\n\\nNikki: Sure, I arrived at the scene around 2:15 PM. The weather was sunny and there were a lot of people around. When I approached the alleyway, I saw a man lying on the ground. He was not moving and there was a pool of blood next to him. I immediately called the police and waited for them to arrive.\\n\\nYou: Did you notice anything unusual or out of place near the crime scene?\\n\\nNikki: Yes, there was a shopping bag nearby with some clothes and a pair of shoes that didn't seem to belong to the man. There was also a bottle of wine next to him.\\n\\nYou: Did you see or hear anyone else at the scene before the police arrived?\\n\\nNikki: I did hear some voices coming from the direction of the park, but I couldn't make out what they were saying. I didn't see anyone else, however.\\n\\nYou: Thank you for your cooperation, Nikki. Before we wrap up, is there anything else you'd like us to know?\\n\\nNikki: No, I think I've covered everything. Could you please provide me with your contact information and let me know the next steps in the investigation process?\\n\\nYou: Absolutely. You can contact me at this number: 555-123-4567. The next steps will depend on the results of the forensic analysis and witness statements. We'll be in touch as soon as we have more information. Is there a preferred method for you to be contacted?\\n\\nNikki: Email would be best. My email address is nikki.moolhuijsen@email.com. Thank you for your time and for allowing me to help in any way I can.\\n\\nYou: You're welcome, Nikki. We appreciate your assistance and will be in touch soon.\\n\\nNikki: Thank you.\\n\\n(End of interview)\\n\\nYou: I'd also like to express my gratitude for your cooperation and ask if you have any feedback for us or the interview process?\\n\\nNikki: No, I\""
